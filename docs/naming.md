# About the Naming of Nehushtan

> He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. (2 Kings 18:4)

Python is a large heavy-bodied non-venomous snake.
It may hurt other lives.
But, one made by brass, seems to be harmful, but actually peaceful.
